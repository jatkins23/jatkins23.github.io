				In West Philadelphia born and raised, on the playground was where I spent most of my days. Hanging out maxing, relaxin all cool and I was shooting some BBall outside of the school, when a couple of guys, that were up to no good, started making trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one little fight and my mom got scared, said you're moving in with your Auntie and Uncle in Bel Air
			</p>
			<p>
				Up to the house around seven or eight and I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo homes smell you later!" Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there, to sit on my throne as the prince of Bel Air.
